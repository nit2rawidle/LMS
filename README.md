# LMS - Libarary Management System

An interactive Library Management System that can run on a local machine as well as on the intranet.
A mini project undertaken by me and my friends during our 5th semester course Software Engineering.

Library management system is a project which aims in developing a
computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library. This project has
many features which are generally not available in normal library management
systems like facility of user login. Manual process of keeping student records,
book records, account details, managing employee is very difficult. There are
various problems also faced by the student in library such as finding any
particular book, information whether book is available or not, searching of
books using ISBN number etc. To eliminate this manual system, library
management system has been developed. Library Management System will
handle all the current issues faced by the students and by its admin personnel.
It has a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole
system. It has a facility where student after logging in their accounts can see list
of books issued and its issue date and return date.

maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
